# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🎯 Objective
This project aims to explore the famous Titanic dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis techniques. The goal is to understand patterns, relationships between features, and how different factors affected passenger survival.

---

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is the **Titanic Dataset** available [here on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset) or provided as `Titanic-Dataset.csv`.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- NumPy 🔢
- Seaborn & Matplotlib 📉
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

---

## 📊 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Viewed first few rows
   - Checked shape, data types, and null values

2. **Summary Statistics**
   - Used `describe()` and `info()` for quick overview
   - Checked for missing data

3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Histograms for numeric columns
   - Boxplots for outlier detection

4. **Categorical Analysis**
   - Countplots for Sex, Pclass, Embarked vs Survival

5. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Correlation heatmap of numeric columns
   - Pairplot for feature relationships

6. **Insights & Inference**
   - Noted patterns in survival based on gender, class, age, and fare

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🚺 Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males.
- 🛏️ Passengers in **1st class** were more likely to survive.
- 💰 People who paid **higher fares** had better survival odds.
- 👶 Children and younger passengers tended to survive more often.
- 🛳️ Embarkation point **C (Cherbourg)** showed slightly better survival.

## 🧠 Interview Prep
Here are a few questions I prepared answers for:

- What is EDA and why is it important?
- How do boxplots and histograms help?
- What is correlation and multicollinearity?
- How do you handle missing values and outliers?
